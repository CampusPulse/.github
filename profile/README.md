# CampusPulse

CampusPulse is a hub for student-built tools. It is currently based out of the Rochester Institute of Technology and is mainly developed as part of the [FOSS@RIT](https://fossrit.github.io/) community. 

The primary goal of CampusPulse is to provide a single, memorable place for students to go to discover solutions to unsolved problems on campus. You can check out CampusPulse at https://campuspulse.app

**Current CampusPulse Projects**:

- CampusPulse Access - A directory/map of accessible infrastructure (such as door buttons and elevators) on campus allowing students to easily report broken access points to both other students and RIT

<!-- - CampusPulse Bus - A directory of bus routes and schedules for RIT's transportation system, as well as an easy way to report late busses directly to the people who can fix them -->

- [CampusPulse Events](https://events.campuspulse.app) - A feed of public events happening on campus for use by students, such as for making discord bots.

If you would like to get your project added, file an issue in the relevant repository, or reach out through the FOSSRIT community!
