# CampusPulse

CampusPulse is a hub for student-built tools. It is currently based out of the Rochester Institute of Technology.

The primary goal of CampusPulse is to provide a single, memorable place for students to go to discover solutions to unsolved problems on campus.

CampusPulse is mainly developed as part of the [FOSS@RIT](https://fossrit.github.io/) community. If you would like to get your project added, come reach out in that community!
